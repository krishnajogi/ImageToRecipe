# ImageToRecipe
We have over a decillion diverse cuisine which furcate to create hundreds of niche 
styles of diversified flavors, tastes, and appearance. People appreciate food and enjoy 
food photography. So, they post food images on social media platforms like Instagram. 
Behind each flavorful bite, there is an unspoken narrative illustrated in a recipe. 
Unfortunately, just through a glance at the food image, we are unable to understand the 
approach to its preparation procedure. In this project, we have introduced a Reverse 
Cooking system that revives the cooking recipes in the form of recipe names, 
ingredients, and cooking procedures from the inputted food image. The entire model is 
evaluated on a large-scale Recipe dataset and generates highly accurate predictions by 
leveraging the food image. A key challenge may pose during this model building as 
dishes of distinct cuisines may look similar regarding their cooking procedures. To 
solve this, the model has been trained using Convolutional Neural Networks to 
categorize the food images into various categories and output a matched recipe. 
Combining it with a high-level classifier improves retrieval performance. To 
summarize, the model works on automated image recognition over a photographed dish 
and the output of the matched recipe subsequently
